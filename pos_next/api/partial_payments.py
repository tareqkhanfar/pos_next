"""
Partial Payments API for POS Next

Professional implementation following ERPNext best practices:
- Payment Ledger as single source of truth for accounting integrity
- ORM-first approach with optimized SQL where needed
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Proper permission checks and security
- Performance-optimized with minimal N+1 queries

Architecture:
    Payment tracking uses ERPNext's Payment Ledger Entry system which provides:
    - Double-entry accounting compliance
    - Complete audit trail
    - Proper reconciliation support

    Never modify Sales Invoice Payment child table after submission.
    Always create Payment Entry documents which automatically update Payment Ledger.
